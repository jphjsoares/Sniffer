DONE ----> Manually look for interfaces and loop through them and add scroll

DONE ----> Set gaps on the button and the text area (Probably use grid layout)

----> Ask for admin privileges (problems in linux)

DONE ----> Make text area and button be relative to window size

DONE ----> Add interface ID for every found interface

DONE ----> Create an input location

DONE ----> Do multiple checks on the input location

DONE ----> Create error message

DONE ----> Call the function to monitor network with user input

DONE ----> Make sniffed packets visible in the GUI (THE PACKETS WILL ONLY APPEAR AFTER THE LOOP IS DONE)
        We are better off using concurrency here!

----> To be able to stop during the sniffing, add a button to cancel

----> Probably make another class for packet sniffing frames

----> Make sniffing window resizable

FEATURES

----> Let the user be able to choose how much time/packets to handle

----> Give the size of all the packets

----> Use whois to let the user know what IP is being responsible for most of the traffic
