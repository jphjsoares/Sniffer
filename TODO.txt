----> Let the user be able to choose a network adapter (FIGURE OUT A WAY TO OUTPUT A RETURN OF A FUNCTION IN SWING)
        Solution:
            Instead of using nif selector, use manually core.Pcaps.findAllDevs and loop in each network interface
            Don't forget to handle the user choice (simulate nif.doSelect in swing)

----> Let the user be able to choose how much time/packets to handle

----> Give the size of all the packets

----> Use whois to let the user know what IP is being responsible for most of the traffic
